# Setting up Your Environment

## Setting Up

In this section, we will load the required R packages and set up our environment.

## Loading the dplyr package

`dplyr` is one of the packages in the tidyverse, and it helps in data manipulation.

```{r setup-dplyr, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# Load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)

# Print the version of dplyr
packageVersion("dplyr")
```

The `echo=TRUE` option in the chunk means that both the R code and its output will be included in the rendered document.
